Remember to remove the # symbol to install these packages. We will also call in our Palmer Penguins data set that you downloaded earlier.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#install.packages(\"dplyr\")\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n#install.packages(\"tidyverse\")\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nlibrary(palmerpenguins)\ndata(package = 'palmerpenguins')\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### NAs in R {.unnumbered}\nBefore we begin, we must first check for missing values.\nR *does not* love when NAs get thrown into the mix, especially when running numerical commands, like the **mean** function.  \nTo resolve any missing values, we must first determine if there are any NAs, and where they may be. \n\nFirst, we will look to see IF and WHERE potential NAs are in our data set.\nWe will do this by using the **which** function, followed by the **is.na** function within our penguins data set. \nWhat these two functions do together is which locates all of the columns where NAs are present, based on the **is.na** function. \nIf we wanted to find all of the columns where there were no NAs, we could simply change **is.na** to **!is.na**.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nwhich(is.na(penguins), arr.ind = TRUE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n      row col\n [1,]   4   3\n [2,] 272   3\n [3,]   4   4\n [4,] 272   4\n [5,]   4   5\n [6,] 272   5\n [7,]   4   6\n [8,] 272   6\n [9,]   4   7\n[10,]   9   7\n[11,]  10   7\n[12,]  11   7\n[13,]  12   7\n[14,]  48   7\n[15,] 179   7\n[16,] 219   7\n[17,] 257   7\n[18,] 269   7\n[19,] 272   7\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow that we see there are NAs riddled throughout, we will name a new object (using the same name), but omitting all NAs. \n\nIn this example, I am using the **na.omit** function to remove all NAs from our penguin data set. \nI am also naming this new object (penguins again for ease).\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npenguins <-\n  na.omit(penguins) #I must add this because there are NAs within this data set and these functions will not work otherwise \n```\n:::\n\n\n\n### select() {.unnumbered}\n\nLet's start by selecting for only the columns we are interested in. \nThis can be useful when removing variables we are not currently interested in. \n**Remember**, at any manipulation, you can save the changes as a new object which will maintain the integrity of the original if you must back track for whatever reason. \n\nIn this example, we use the **select** function to choose which columns we want to look at. \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# select()\npenguins %>% #From the penguins data set\n  select(species, bill_length_mm, year) # selecting columns species, bill_length, and      year \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 333 x 3\n   species bill_length_mm  year\n   <fct>            <dbl> <int>\n 1 Adelie            39.1  2007\n 2 Adelie            39.5  2007\n 3 Adelie            40.3  2007\n 4 Adelie            36.7  2007\n 5 Adelie            39.3  2007\n 6 Adelie            38.9  2007\n 7 Adelie            39.2  2007\n 8 Adelie            41.1  2007\n 9 Adelie            38.6  2007\n10 Adelie            34.6  2007\n# ... with 323 more rows\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow that we have selected for certain columns, let's say we want to view everything except for one or several columns.\nInstead of typing out every column we want, we can simple type out the one(s) we don't.\n\nIn this example, I tell R to remove the sex column using the **select** function again.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# select()\npenguins %>% #From the penguins data set\n  select(-sex)# selecting all columns except for sex\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 333 x 7\n   species island    bill_length_mm bill_depth_mm flipper_length~1 body_~2  year\n   <fct>   <fct>              <dbl>         <dbl>            <int>   <int> <int>\n 1 Adelie  Torgersen           39.1          18.7              181    3750  2007\n 2 Adelie  Torgersen           39.5          17.4              186    3800  2007\n 3 Adelie  Torgersen           40.3          18                195    3250  2007\n 4 Adelie  Torgersen           36.7          19.3              193    3450  2007\n 5 Adelie  Torgersen           39.3          20.6              190    3650  2007\n 6 Adelie  Torgersen           38.9          17.8              181    3625  2007\n 7 Adelie  Torgersen           39.2          19.6              195    4675  2007\n 8 Adelie  Torgersen           41.1          17.6              182    3200  2007\n 9 Adelie  Torgersen           38.6          21.2              191    3800  2007\n10 Adelie  Torgersen           34.6          21.1              198    4400  2007\n# ... with 323 more rows, and abbreviated variable names 1: flipper_length_mm,\n#   2: body_mass_g\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWithin the **select** function, you can also look for items based on their spelling.

Notice here that R will *default* to the order of small-large with the **arrange** function.  \n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# select() and arrange()\npenguins %>%\n  select(species,
